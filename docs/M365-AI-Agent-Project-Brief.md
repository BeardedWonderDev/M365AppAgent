### MVP Use Cases (Phase 1)

#### Password Reset Requests
**AI Detection Patterns**:
- "User locked out", "forgot password", "can't access email"
- Context: User identification, urgency indicators, authentication status

**Risk Assessment**: Medium (temporary access vs security)
**Automation Scope**: Force password reset, account unlock, MFA reset
**Approval Flow**: Biometric confirmation with 5-minute approval window

#### Group Membership Changes
**AI Detection Patterns**:
- "Add John to marketing team", "remove access to finance folder"
- Context: User role, group permissions, business justification

**Risk Assessment**: Variable (based on group sensitivity)
**Automation Scope**: Security groups, distribution groups, Teams membership
**Approval Flow**: Risk-based approval levels with detailed before/after visualization

### Security & Compliance Framework

#### Multi-Layer Security
1. **AI Validation**: Dual-model consensus required for action classification
2. **Risk Scoring**: Dynamic assessment based on user, group, and business impact
3. **Biometric Gates**: Platform-native biometric confirmation for all approvals
4. **Time-Boxing**: Approval windows with automatic escalation
5. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging with video confirmation capability

#### Compliance Standards
- **SOC 2 Type II** compliance framework
- **ISO 27001** security controls
- **GDPR** data protection requirements
- **HIPAA** considerations for healthcare MSPs
