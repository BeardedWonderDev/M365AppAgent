# AI TenantShield - Strategic Decisions Summary
**M365 AI Agent MSP Automation Platform**

*Date: September 3, 2025*  
*Status: Strategic Planning Complete - Ready for Development*

---

## üéØ **Final Strategic Decisions**

### **1. App Name: AI TenantShield** ‚úÖ
**Rationale:**
- **Clear Function**: Immediately communicates AI-powered tenant protection
- **Security Focus**: "Shield" conveys protection and security
- **AI Prominent**: "AI" prefix makes automation capability obvious
- **M365 Specific**: "Tenant" clearly indicates Microsoft 365 focus
- **Professional**: Sounds enterprise-grade and trustworthy
- **Trademark Safe**: Descriptive terms with low trademark risk

**Branding Guidelines:**
- Primary Name: **AI TenantShield**
- Tagline: *"AI-Powered M365 Protection for MSPs"*
- App Store Names: "AI TenantShield" (iOS/Android)
- Domain Strategy: AITenantShield.com (to be secured)

### **2. Push Notification Architecture: Azure Notification Hubs** ‚úÖ
**Rationale:**
- **Azure Integration**: Seamless integration with Azure Functions backend
- **Multi-Platform**: Single service handles iOS and Android
- **MSP Scalability**: Built for multi-tenant environments
- **Cost Effective**: Free tier covers 1M pushes/month, perfect for MVP
- **Enterprise Features**: Rich payloads, templates, analytics
- **Template System**: Dynamic content based on risk level and tenant

**Technical Implementation:**
```yaml
Service: Azure Notification Hubs
Configuration:
  - Namespace: "ai-tenantshield-notifications"
  - Hubs: Separate for dev/staging/prod environments
  - Region: West US 2 (cost-optimized region)
  - Tier: Standard (for templates and analytics)

Notification Types:
  - Password Reset: Standard priority
  - Group Membership: High priority with action buttons
  - High Risk: Critical priority with rich content
  - Escalations: Time-sensitive with custom sounds

Cost: ~$10/month for standard tier, scales with usage
```

### **3. Monitoring Strategy: Simple & Essential** ‚úÖ
**Rationale:**
- **MVP Focus**: Start simple, scale monitoring as product grows
- **Cost Conscious**: ~$30-50/month vs $500+ for comprehensive monitoring
- **Practical**: Focus on what's needed to keep system running
- **Growth Path**: Clear evolution to advanced monitoring when ready

**Implementation Plan:**
```yaml
Phase 1 (MVP): Essential Monitoring Only
Components:
  - Application Insights (automatic with Azure Functions)
  - 5 Critical Azure Monitor Alerts
  - Basic Azure Dashboard
  - Simple Status Page

Critical Alerts:
  1. AI TenantShield system down (>5min downtime)
  2. AI API error rate high (>10% failures)
  3. Push notification delivery failures (>20% failure rate)
  4. Key Vault access denied (authentication issues)
  5. Cost threshold exceeded (budget protection)

Setup Time: 1 hour total
Monthly Cost: $30-50
Notification: Email/SMS to 2 people maximum
```
